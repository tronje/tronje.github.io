      About me </h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Tronje, and I'm a 20 year old Computer Science student at the University of Hamburg.
      Currently, I'm in my 5th BSc. semester, and so far my main interests are theoretical computer science and system programming.
      I wouldn't say I dislike web development, but I just can't seem to enthral myself with it. That's why this page is a run-of-the-mill
      design hosted on github-pages.<br>
      Besides academic endeavors, I try to be very active at the CS department of the university. I'm a member of the student council and I
      participate in the orientation unit for new students at the department every year. If you'd like to know more about these duties, feel free
      to email me and ask.<br>
      Outside of university activities, I enjoy coding in my freetime, too. For some examples, visit my GitHub page or click the "Projects"-Button
      (coming soon). For fun little things I often use Python, and for more serious work C++. I've also done quite a bit of C programming for
      uni classes.<br>
      Other things I like doing extracurriculary are cooking and video games, with the latter being hardly surprising, I suppose.
      For physical excercise I've recently started lifting weights, which is a lot of fun, and offers some well needed contrast to sitting in front
      of a computer for the better part of a day.

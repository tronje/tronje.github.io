    <h2>
      About me </h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Tronje, and I'm a 21 year old Computer Science student at the University of Hamburg.
      Currently, I'm in my 7th BSc. semester, and so far my main interests are high performance and system programming.
      While I'm not too fond of front-end web-development, I do have some experience with it, and have to admit that WebGL is
      quite fun to code and play around with its capabilities.
      <br>
      <br>
      Besides academic endeavors, I try to be very active at the CS department of the university. I was a member of the student council and I
      participate in the orientation unit for new students at the department every year. This entails guiding and supervising a group of around ten
      new students through a week filled with various activities, tailored to teach them about uni in general, the (social) infrastucture at the CS
      department, as well as some more general principals, such as working as a team and socializing in general. This work is honrary and the only reward is
      getting to know the new students and helping them adjust.
      <br>
      <br>
      Outside of university activities, I enjoy coding in my freetime, too. For some examples, visit my GitHub page, though at the moment it
      only really features uni stuff, which is keeping me quite busy.
      For fun little things I often use Python which is very intuitive, and for more performance-oriented things I use C, which at times `I find a lot of fun to code,
      because it's the exact opposite of a bloated, confusing language. The trade-off is of course that at other times, it can be very annoying to do even some
      simple operation, or find a bug related to sloppy memory management. Oh, and it's super fast of course.
      More recently, I've discovered Rust, which is incredibly intriguing and also a lot of fun to code.
      Go seems like a cool language for loads of different applications, though I haven't had the chance to use it outside of some basic
      katas.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm also a passionate amateur vegetarian cook, which, I promise, is not at all as boring as it may sound to some people. Figuring out new twists on recipes
      or getting a dish just right is as rewarding as solving a difficult coding challenge, with the added benefit that you get to eat your work afterwards.
      <br>
      <br>
      To satisfy a common clich√©, I also love video games. I won't write an adoring explanation like I attempted with the cooking thing; it's just nice to take one's
      mind off things for a while sometimes.

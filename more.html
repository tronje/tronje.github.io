    <h2>
      About me </h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Tronje, and I'm a 20 year old Computer Science student at the University of Hamburg.
      Currently, I'm in my 6th BSc. semester, and so far my main interests are high performance and system programming.
      I'm not too fond of front-end web-development, but I do have some experience with it.<br>
      Besides academic endeavors, I try to be very active at the CS department of the university. I was a member of the student council and I
      participate in the orientation unit for new students at the department every year. If you'd like to know more about these duties, feel free
      to email me and ask.<br>
      Outside of university activities, I enjoy coding in my freetime, too. For some examples, visit my GitHub page, though at the moment it
      only really features uni stuff, which is keeping me quite busy.
      For fun little things I often use Python which is very intuitive, and for more performance-oriented things I use C, which I find a lot of fun to code,
      because it can be used for pretty much anything, while being fast and efficient.
      <br>
      Other things I like doing extracurriculary are cooking and playing video games, with the latter being hardly surprising, I suppose.
      I do try to stay physically active, but I've never really focused on any sport in particular, and at the moment just try to get to the
      gym every now and then.
    </p>
